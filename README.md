Open Data Metadata Guide
=======

Metadata - descriptive information about the data you publish - is critical to helping visitors find and use published data effectively. Good metadata reduces the need for visitors to seek personal assistance, helps prevent misinterpretation of data, and encourages higher data quality.

Metadata is generally divided into two types:
Metadata that provides an overview of the data. This kind of metadata helps people find the data through internet searches, while navigating your portal, or even while navigating other data portals which might include your catalog.
Metadata that provides details about specific parts of your data. This kind of metadata enables people to use your data effectively, by helping them understand the various elements it includes and potential limitations.

This guide avoids the details of specific technologies; however, it takes into account existing (and emerging) national and international standards for metadata. Refer to the [Additional Resources](additional-resources.md) section for more information.
